# Changelog

pitwall uses patch versioning while it is pre-1.0: every release bumps the last
number (`v0.0.1`, `v0.0.2`, ...). A release is a git tag on `main`;
`scripts/install.sh` stamps the binary with `git describe`, and
`pitwall --version` prints it.

To cut a release: add a section below, commit it, then
`git tag -a v0.0.N -m "pitwall v0.0.N"` and `git push origin main v0.0.N`.

## Unreleased

- `~/.config/pitwall/config.toml` for keybindings, theme, fonts and pane
  spacing, reloaded live. `pitwall config init / check / default / path /
  schema`, with a generated JSON Schema for editor completion and checks.
- Two keybinding presets: **conventional** (the new default, Linux terminal
  conventions such as Ctrl+Shift+T, Ctrl+Tab, Ctrl+Shift+O/E) and **aide**
  (the previous Alt-key bindings). Single actions can be rebound or unbound.
- Themes: aide-dark, aide-light, tokyo-night, catppuccin-mocha, custom theme
  files, and per-color overrides. The daemon answers terminal color queries
  with the theme's palette.
- Configurable UI and terminal fonts, sizes, line height and fallback fonts.
- Tabs are listed under their session in the sidebar instead of a strip
  above the panes, with a hover "+" for a new tab.
- Sessions show the agent's topic as their name until you name them.
- Drag sessions and groups to reorder them; drop a session on a group to
  move it there.
- Hide the sidebar with Ctrl+Shift+B (Ctrl+B in the aide preset).
- Panes sit 4dp in from the window edges and 4dp apart.
- The sidebar shows the new pitwall logo.

## v0.0.1

The first tagged build.

- Native Gio window with an aide-style sidebar beside split terminal panes.
- Starts like tmux: straight into a shell in the folder you launch it from.
- Sessions with generated names (`swift-otter`), tabs, and splits. Exiting a
  pane closes it; the tab and session close when empty; the window closes with
  the last session.
- Ctrl+T tab mode, Alt+J/K/H/L navigation and the Alt-hold session switcher.
- Live state for every session: the command a terminal runs, and Claude Code
  or Codex working, waiting for input, asking for approval, plan ready, done,
  or failed. Exact through hooks, read from the screen without them.
- Tab titles follow the agent's terminal title; agents can name their tab with
  `pitwall tab rename`.
- Groups made after the fact, one-click grouping by folder, and git worktree
  sessions.
- Detach and attach, and `pitwall ls / new / attach / detach / kill / rename`.
- The daemon owns the PTYs: closing the window keeps sessions running, and
  after a reboot sessions come back with agents resumed.
- Desktop notifications when a session needs you.
- `pitwall hooks install` merges the hooks into Claude Code and Codex config.
